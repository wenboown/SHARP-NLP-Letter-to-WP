<h3>Preprocessing<a class="headerlink" href="#preprocessing" title="Permalink to this heading">¶</a></h3>
<p>To analyze only the speech of the subjects, we needed to identify and
extract the parts of their voice from the whole interview since only one
channel was used in the recording. Given that manual transcription
contained the timestamps that indicate when the subject is speaking, we
used that information to segment the recording and then join only
subject’s segments to generate a new audio file.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="metrics">
<h3>Metrics<a class="headerlink" href="#metrics" title="Permalink to this heading">¶</a></h3>
<p>Acoustic features: Based on the literature as well as our previous work
on the characterization of CHR subjects<sup>1,2,3,4</sup>, we extracted
several features that can capture flattened intonation, disturbed flow
of speech (e.g., voice break), changes in speech rate and other
characteristics found in studies that characterize speech in
schizophrenia patients. All these features were extracted in the
pre-processed audio containing only the subject’s speech in Mandarin. We
grouped all the extracted features in 8 categories: pitch variations,
changes in rhythm, voice stability, spectral characterization, vowel
space, MFCCs, chroma features, and noise measurements (see Table 2).
More information about the processing used to compute these features can
be found here<sup>4-6</sup>.</p>
<p>English-based linguistic features: To perform a thorough
characterization of the content of the subject’s speech, we extracted
features at the word, sentence, and paragraph level. To do so, we
prepared the text to be analyzed by tokenizing and lemmatizing it using
the NLTK library<sup>16</sup>. In addition, we only kept the content words
of the text by removing the stop words (e.g., “then”) from our analysis,
using the provided list from natural language toolkit library in python
(NLTK):sup:<cite>7</cite>.</p>
<p>At the word level, we used part of speech (PoS) tagging<sup>8</sup> to
obtain the normalized frequency (percentage) of different parts of
speech such as adjectives, verbs, etc. used by the subject during the
interview (see Table 2). We also quantified content and unique words
normalized by the total number of words uttered by the subject.</p>
<p>In the case of features extracted at the sentence level, we used two
categories: graph-based and speech coherence. For graph-based features,
each word (previously lemmatized) becomes a graph node while consecutive
words (two nodes) are connected using edges. From that graphical
representation of the text, we computed standard mathematical graph
properties listed in<sup>9</sup> and summarized in Table 2. To quantify
speech coherence, we used the Universal Sentence Encoder<sup>10</sup> text
embedding, an algorithm trained by Google with a deep averaging network
encoder, that numerically represents each text (word, sentence,
paragraph) using 512 dimensions. Once each sentence is vectorized,
cosine similarity is used to evaluate the similarity (coherence) between
a question (interviewer) and the answer (subject), as well as
consecutive answers of the subjects. To summarize each of these
coherence metrics, we report 4 statistical descriptors (percentiles 5,
50, 95 and MAD (i.e. mean absolute deviation, which is a robust measure
of variability). Only for English transcripts (to avoid redundancy) did
we also quantify the number of interactions between the interviewer and
the subject by counting the transitions from questions to answers (i.e.,
number of switches).</p>
<p>Finally, for the analysis at a paragraph level, the whole content of the
subject speech was used to perform sentiment analysis using Watson
Natural Language Understanding API<sup>11</sup>. This tool provides the
following metrics: overall sentiment (positive, negative), as well as
scores for specific sentiments (i.e., anger, disgust, fear, joy, and
sadness).</p>
<p>Mandarin-based linguistic features: To be able to compare performance
between the use of Mandarin transcripts and their translated transcripts
in English we extracted the same type of features described above but
with the following variations in the text processing. To perform
tokenization in Mandarin, we need to consider that this language is
written without spacing. Therefore, we used the Electra base version of
NLP features trained on the close-source Chinese corpus via HanLP 2.1
library<sup>12</sup>. By using this library, we obtained the tokenized
words and POS tagging based on the Penn Chinese Treebank (3.0):sup:<cite>13</cite>.
Unlike English, Mandarin does not require lemmatization. Specific to
Mandarin, POS features included other categories besides the ones
reported for English, including localizers, associative/possessive, and
measure words, among others. Also, wh-words are not included among POS
tags in Mandarin.</p>
<p>For coherence features, we used Sentence Transformers<sup>14</sup> to
obtain the sentence embedding. The consequent steps are a bit different
from English. For Q-A coherence, the cosine similarity is computed
between the question and the first sentence in the answer paragraph. For
A-A coherence, cosine similarity is computed on 1<sup>st</sup>,
2<sup>nd</sup>, 3<sup>rd</sup> order within the answer paragraph, i.e.,
between neighboring sentences (1:sup:<cite>st</cite> order), next-neighboring
sentences (2:sup:<cite>nd</cite> order), and skipping 2 sentences in between
(3:sup:<cite>rd</cite> order).</p>
<p>For graph-based features, each tokenized word is a node. After these
pre-processing steps, the feature extraction in Mandarin is equivalent
to the English one. However, for the sentiment analysis, the used
library<sup>20</sup> does not provide specific sentiments (e.g., anger)
for Mandarin. Therefore, we also incorporate local sentiment by
computing overall sentiment score for each answer of the subject and
summarized these values using 5 descriptors (median, interquartile
range, MAD (median absolute deviation), robust minimum and maximum).</p>

<p>A total of 341 features were extracted for each subject’s session.
However, there were two issues that we considered before performing any
analysis: 1) Age and education years were not matched in both cohorts
(CHR and HC); and 2) Features can be highly correlated, meaning that we
could have redundant information in the characterization, potentially
decreasing the performance of any machine learning algorithm. For the
first issue, we corrected the features for both age and education years
by regressing the features to these variables in the HC cohort and used
the same parameters to remove possible effects in the CHR cohort. For
the second issue, we measured the correlation between features, and
discarded features that had an associated correlation coefficient of
0.95 or more. After this procedure, we ended with 300 features. After
addressing these issues, we performed two main experiments. The first
experiment was to evaluate if the features can help us distinguish
between spoken language in CHR and HC. The second experiment was to
evaluate if the extracted features can be used to infer SIPS/SOPS
positive and negative symptoms for patients. For both experiments,
features were normalized to have mean=0, variance=1, and performance was
evaluated using 10-fold cross validation. Depending on the experiment
(classification or inference), different machine learning algorithms
were used. For classification, we used random forest and support vector
machines (SVM) with two different kernels, Linear and RBF. These
experiments were performed independently for each of the three types of
features extracted as well as the combination of the three; in all
cases, no significant differences were observed between the classifier
models. In addition, for classification, we repeated the experiments 20
times to identify the mean prediction accuracy. Finally, to complement
these findings, a post-hoc analysis that checked for the most relevant
features in the best models was performed. All statistical measurements
(Spearman correlation, Wilcoxon paired t-test and Kolmogorov Smirnov)
used in this study considered the non-normal distribution of the
analyzed variables.</p>

<h3>Classification between CHR v. HC<a class="headerlink" href="#classification-between-chr-v-hc" title="Permalink to this heading">¶</a></h3>
<p>High performance results were obtained for the three types of features
used in this analysis (Supplementary Figure 1). Best accuracy values
ranged from 0.88 (only acoustic features) to 0.95 (only English-based
linguistic features), while by using the AUC metric, the performance
values ranged from 0.91 (only acoustic features) to 0.99 (only
English-based linguistic features). All performance values were higher
than chance probability. When we compared the performance between
English and Mandarin-based linguistic features, there is only a
statistically significant difference for one classifier: RBF SVM
(Wilcoxon paired test, p=2E-6) and the difference is marginal. While
performance results using only acoustic features are very high, results
are significantly lower than linguistic features for all classifiers.
There is no improvement with respect to the highest performance model
after joining all the type of features. In fact, results using only
English-based linguistic features are significantly better, especially
for RBF (Wilcoxon paired test, p=2E-6) and linear SVM (Wilcoxon paired
test, p=1E-4).</p>
<p>A post hoc analysis to find the most relevant features in the models was
performed only for Linear SVM, as it assigns a coefficient to each
feature. Supplementary Figure 2 shows the results of the top 5 features
across 20 runs for each fold (200 values). Positive weights indicate
that the value of a feature is higher for the CHR cohort while a
negative weight indicates that the value of the feature is higher for HC
cohort. Among the most relevant acoustic features, we found that
bandwidth of the first formant (robust minimum), voiced only pause
duration and spectral spread are higher for CHR while total duration of
pauses and chroma #11 are higher for HC. Note that the top 5 acoustic
features have similar weights in the model which indicates that their
contribution is similar. We also observed that similar features between
English and Mandarin such as coherence between questions and answer
(robust minimum) have the same orientation in the weight analysis (See
Supplementary Figure 2 ), this feature being more predominant in
Mandarin (KS test for English: p=6E-5, and for Mandarin: p=4.5E-6). An
additional analysis (see Supplementary Figure 3) showed that the
correlation between languages for coherence is r=0.70. We also noticed
that between predicative-adjective (Mandarin) and adjective (English),
there is a correlation of r=0.60. Correlations between other features
are lower (r&lt;0.60) which may indicate that each type of feature is
capturing different aspects of the interviews’ content.</p>

<h3>Inference of SIPS/SOPS positive and negative symptom scores.<a class="headerlink" href="#inference-of-sips-sops-positive-and-negative-symptom-scores" title="Permalink to this heading">¶</a></h3>
<p>Only acoustic features were able to infer SIPS/SOPS scores with high
performance (negative symptoms: r= 0.69, p=8E-4, positive symptoms:
r=0.49, p=3E-2). Using linguistic features, the achieved performances
were low (r&lt;0.1) except for Mandarin-based linguistic features. These
features can infer negative symptoms with r=0.36; however, given the
small cohort, the results are not statistically significant (p=1E-1).
When we analyzed the relevant features in the acoustic models, we found
that degree of voice break and standard deviation (std) of the period
are the most relevant features to infer positive symptoms. A statistical
test reveals that these features have correlations of r=0.75 (p=1E-4)
and r=0.60 (p=5E-3). On the other hand, the most relevant features for
negative symptoms are related to MFCC coefficients #1 (r=-0.67, p=1E-3)
and #8 (r=0.61, p=4E-3). Lastly, although the model to infer negative
symptoms using Mandarin-based linguistic features did not achieve
statistical significance, we found that the robust minimum of the second
order coherence among answers, one of the extracted features, has a

<p>Supplementary Figure 4 Regression results for acoustic features. a)
Performance of the cross-validated models using 3 different machine
learning algorithms. b) Relevant features to infer positive symptoms
score used in the best model (Lasso). Note that features were corrected
by age and education years so values are also shifted to negative
values. c) Top features to infer negative symptoms used in the best
model (Linear Regression).</p>
